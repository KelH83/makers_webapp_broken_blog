# Apply a Great Debugging Process

> Learning Objective: Follow a debugging process for a web application

Your challenge is to apply a great debugging process and, along the way, [fix some bugs](https://github.com/makersacademy/flask_debugging_exercise).

For each bug, use a four step approach...

1. Investigate
2. Plan
3. Change
4. Validate

### 1. Investigate

The first step is always to investigate, **whilst resisting the temptation to make immediate changes**. To do this, gather information by
- Running the test
- Observing the error message / test failure
- Using `print()`
- Playing with the application in your browser

### 2. Plan

Now that you have some idea as to what / where the bug is, plan your change/s.

- What will you change?
- If you're changing more than one thing, in what order will you make the changes?
- How will you know if it has worked?
- What will you do if it doesn't work?

### 3. Change

Go ahead and make the planned changes.

### 4. Validate

Did your changes work?

## Reflection

- Was the process outlined above useful and is it what you would normally do?
- Did you find yourself wanting to make changes before having a proper plan?
- What was helpful / unhelpful about the error messages from Pytest?
