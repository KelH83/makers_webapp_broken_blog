# Create an HTML Page

## Objective
To create a basic HTML page from scratch, incorporating essential HTML elements and attributes.

## Instructions

### 1. Setup

Create a new file with the extension `.html` (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in your text editor.

### 2. Research

Spend a few minutes researching the basic structure and essential elements of an HTML page - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) may come in handy. Pay attention to the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements, as well as common tags like `<title>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`.

### 3. Implementation

Using the knowledge gained from your research, start building your HTML page in the text editor.
Include the following elements:
* `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
* `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.
* `<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document.
* `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.
* At least one heading (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
* At least one paragraph (`<p>`).
* An image (`<img>`) sourced from the web or locally (ensure you have the image file if using locally).
* A hyperlink (`<a>`) to another webpage.

### 4. Checking your work

Save your HTML file.
- Open the file in a web browser to ensure it displays correctly.
  - Does your link to another webpage work?
  - Does your image display correctly?
  - Where is the <title> value used/visible?
- Make any necessary adjustments until you're satisfied with the layout and content.

### 5. Reflection

Reflect on your experience
- What was challenging?
- What did you find interesting?
- Consider how you can further expand and improve your HTML skills.
