# Test an HTML Form

We've created a small app for you to test. You can find it [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/web_pairing_challenge_untested_form). It's simple web application that lists some users and you can add to the list by submitting the form. Your job is to add some tests.

## The challenge

Your goal is to write some automated tests, using Playwright, for a small application. At the moment, it is entirely untested. First, you'll set up and explore the application. Then you'll write and run some tests, based on how the little app works.

1. Start by [setting up](https://github.com/makersacademy/web_pairing_challenge_untested_form?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up) and [exploring](https://github.com/makersacademy/web_pairing_challenge_untested_form?tab=readme-ov-file#exploration) the app, then come back here
2. Make a list of tests that you would like to write
3. Write your tests, making sure you test several different uses of the form
4. Run your tests
