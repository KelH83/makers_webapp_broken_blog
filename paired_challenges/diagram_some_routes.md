# Diagram Some Routes

> Learning Objective: Explain how HTTP requests and responses work at a high level

Imagine you're going to build a clone of AirBnB. The application will allow people to sign up, sign in and list a space for other users to rent. The spaces that are available to rent will be visible in a list on the homepage.

Your task is to think about the requests and responses involved in...

1. Creating a space
2. Viewing a list of spaces

> You can assume the user has already signed up for an account and signed into the application

Do a diagram for each request / response cycle being sure to include...

- The type of request (`GET` or `POST`)
- Any query or body parameters required
- How the server interacts with the database (you get "extra points" for including some SQL)
- The status code of the response
- What might be included in the response body
